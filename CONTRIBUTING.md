## Hacktoberfest Participation

This repository participates in Hacktoberfest! We welcome contributions throughout October and have labeled issues that are good for first-time contributors with `hacktoberfest` and `good-first-issue` tags.

### Hacktoberfest Guidelines

- Pull requests should be meaningful and address an existing issue
- Low-quality PRs (like typo fixes) may be marked as `invalid` or `spam`
- Check the [Hacktoberfest quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/qualitystandards) before submitting

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parazeeknova/zephyr.git
   cd zephyr
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   We use pnpm as our package manager

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**

   ```bash
   # Get an example / temp database from vercel for `.env` file and place it in `packages/db`.
   # Get your storage bucket from uploadthing and add it to `.env` file, Will be replaced with amazon s3 bucket later.
   # Format is in `.env.example` file
   ```

4. **Run the development servers**

   ```bash
   turbo dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Choose an issue** to work on or create a new one
2. **Create a new branch** from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them using conventional commits:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new social sharing feature"
   ```

4. **Push your branch** and create a pull request

### Conventional Commits

We follow the Conventional Commits specification. Commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Example:

```
feat(frontend): add new user profile page

- Implement responsive design
- Add avatar upload functionality

Closes #123
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR addresses an existing issue (if not, create one)
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add tests for new features
4. Make sure all tests pass
5. Get at least one code review from a maintainer
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

### PR Title Format

Follow the same convention as commit messages:

```
feat(scope): brief description
```

## Coding Standards

- **Frontend:** We use Biome
- **Backend:** Follow Node.js best practices
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for new features (soon to be implemented)
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation as needed

### Code Style

```bash
# Check code style
pnpm run biome:check

# Fix code style issues
pnpm run biome:fix
```
