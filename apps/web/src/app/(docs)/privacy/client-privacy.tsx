							<p>
								We collect certain personal information necessary for platform
								functionality and user experience enhancement. This includes
								basic identification details such as your name and username,
								which help create your unique identity within our platform. Your
								email address serves as a primary contact point and
								authentication method. We also maintain profile information that
								you choose to share, including profile pictures and optional
								biographical details. When you choose to connect social media
								accounts, we store these connections to enable integrated
								features and enhanced functionality.
							</p>

							<p>
								Authentication data from third-party services is securely
								processed and stored when you choose to use alternative login
								methods. This information is handled with strict security
								protocols and is used solely for authentication purposes. We
								maintain this data in encrypted form and regularly audit our
								authentication systems to ensure continued security.
							</p>

							<h3 className="font-medium text-xl">Content Information</h3>
							<p>
								As you interact with our platform, we collect and store content
								that you create and share. This includes posts, comments, and
								any media uploads you make to the platform. Your interactions
								with other users' content, such as reactions and responses, are
								also recorded to enable social features and maintain
